## Getting Started

Contributing to OpenWillis can be a rewarding experience. To ensure a smooth contribution process for everyone involved, we‚Äôve outlined some steps and guidelines you should be aware of before you start contributing.


### Set Up Local Development Environment

To start contributing to OpenWillis, you need to set up your local development environment. You can find the instructions in the [Getting started](https://github.com/bklynhlth/openwillis/wiki/Getting-started) wiki page. After that make sure to read through the [List of functions](https://github.com/bklynhlth/openwillis/wiki/2.-List-of-functions) wiki page to understand the different functions and their purpose and the [Research Guidelines](https://github.com/bklynhlth/openwillis/wiki/3.-Research-guidelines) wiki page to gain a deeper understanding on how the input data should be structured and collected.


### What to Know Before You Get Started

Before you begin contributing to OpenWillis, there are a few things you should know:



* **Project Overview**: Familiarize yourself with the project‚Äôs goals, architecture, and development roadmap. This information can be found in the README file and the project wiki.
* **Issue Tracking**: We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. Before creating a new issue, please check to ensure it hasn‚Äôt already been reported. If you find an existing issue that matches your own, add a comment to let us know you‚Äôre experiencing the same problem.
* **Contribution Process**: Contributions to OpenWillis should be made via pull requests to the latest version‚Äôs branch and not directly to main. Each pull request should be linked to an open issue. If there isn‚Äôt an issue that matches your contribution, please create one before submitting your pull request.

Getting involved in an open-source project like OpenWillis is not only about submitting code. There are many ways to contribute:



* **Reporting Bugs**: If you find a bug, report it via GitHub issues. Include as much detail as possible to help us understand and replicate the issue.
* **Suggesting Enhancements**: Have an idea for making OpenWillis better? We‚Äôd love to hear it! Create an issue to suggest enhancements.
* **Improving Documentation**: Good documentation is crucial for any project. If you see areas that could be improved or clarified, don‚Äôt hesitate to contribute or ask for clarifications.

By following these guidelines, you‚Äôll be well on your way to contributing to OpenWillis.


## How to Contribute

Contributing to OpenWillis involves a range of activities from reporting bugs, suggesting enhancements, to contributing code. Here‚Äôs how you can contribute:


### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. If you find a bug in the project, please check the existing issues to ensure it hasn‚Äôt been reported already. If it‚Äôs a new issue, open a new issue and include:



* A clear and descriptive title.
* A detailed description of the bug. Include steps to reproduce the issue, the expected outcome, and the actual outcome.
* Any relevant information such as error messages, screenshots, or system information.


### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancements and feature requests are also tracked as GitHub issues. Before suggesting an enhancement, please check if it has already been suggested. If not, open a new issue and include:



* A clear and descriptive title.
* A detailed explanation of the proposed feature or enhancement. Include any specific use cases or benefits.
* Any preliminary ideas on how to implement the enhancement, if you have them.


### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to start contributing code? Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`. These issues are well-suited for new contributors. Here are some steps to follow:



1. **Fork the repository**: Create your own fork of the project to work on your contribution.
2. **Clone your fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine and set up the development environment.
3. **Create a branch**: Always make your changes in a new branch specific to the issue you‚Äôre addressing.
4. **Make your changes**: Work on the issue as described, adhering to the project‚Äôs coding standards and guidelines.
5. **Commit your changes**: Use clear and meaningful commit messages. Follow any commit message guidelines the project has.
6. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
7. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Open a pull request from your fork to the latest version branch of the original repository. Provide a clear and detailed title and description of your changes. Link to the issue your PR addresses.

For more detailed instructions on how to prepare your pull request, see [Pull Requests](#bookmark=id.2s8eyo1).

Contributing to OpenWillis is not just about code. You can contribute in many ways:



* **Improving documentation**
* **Reviewing pull requests**
* **Participating in discussions on issues**

Every contribution is valuable and appreciated.


## Pull Requests

The process for submitting a pull request is as follows:



1. **Link the PR to an Issue**: Before submitting a PR, make sure it‚Äôs linked to an issue. If the PR addresses an issue not yet reported, please create an issue first.
2. **Do Not Submit Drafts**: Only submit PRs that are complete and ready for review. Drafts or work-in-progress PRs should be marked as such.
3. **Follow the Style Guides**: Ensure your code adheres to the style guides outlined below.
4. **Pass All Checks**: Your PR should pass all the checks and tests set up by the project. This may include unit tests, linting, and other CI/CD processes.
5. **Review Process**: Once submitted, your PR will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Be open to feedback and ready to make changes as requested.
6. **Merge**: After your PR has been approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the project.
